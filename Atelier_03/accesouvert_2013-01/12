*Date: *1 and 2 July 2013
*Location: *The British Library, London, UK

JISC Collections <http://www.jisc-collections.ac.uk>, in partnership with O=
APEN
Foundation <http://www.oapen.org/home>, is holding a* two-day international
conference *intended for all stakeholders in scholarly communications
including European research funders, senior institutional managers,
publishers, learned societies, librarians and researchers. The conference
aims *to raise awareness of open access, to increase understanding of
key **challenges
and to identify where international common policies an**d frameworks could
support the adoption of open access monograph publishing in the humanities
and social sciences (HSS)*.

In the UK, the release of the Finch
Report<http://www.researchinfonet.org/publish/finch/>alongside the
Research Councils UK=92s policy is causing much concern in the
humanities and social science (HSS) community who feel that policy is being
developed with little consideration of the specificities of HSS research or
regard for the monograph publishing model. *The monograph is the gold
standard* and in many disciplines remains the primary method through which
humanities and social science researchers communicate their work. It is
also an essential part of career progression and reputation establishment
for many young researchers.

In the last two decades, *monographs sales have rapidly declined* from an
average of over 2000 to just 200 =96 in line with library budgets reduction=
s.
In order to support the continued existence of the monograph and to move
HSS in line with other areas of scholarly communication and research
funder=92s policies, *a new open access business model is required*. Howeve=
r,
transitioning to new models requires institutional and cultural change
alongside experimentation, testing and consultation.

*Now is the time for consultation, collaboration and commitment to explore*.
Monographs received few paragraphs in the Finch Report and at previous
conferences and events questions about open access questions about
monograph publishing have been met with shrugs. Sponsored by the *AHRC*
<http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/Pages/Home.aspx>and *ESRC*
<http://www.esrc.ac.uk/>and hosted by
* The British Library* <http://www.bl.uk/>, this conference will be the *fi=
rst
to tackle open access monographs in the humanities and social sciences head
on*.

*Key topics of the conference will include new open access business models,
maintaining quality, the future of peer-review, creative commons licensing
and international policy development*. Current confirmed speakers include:

   - *Kathle**en Fitzpatrick - Director of Scholarly Communication at the
   Modern Language
Association<http://www.plannedobsolescence.net/kathleen-fitzpatrick/>
   *
   - *Frances Pinter - Executive Director of Knowledge Unlatched
   <http://www.knowledgeunlatched.org/>
   *
   - *Martin Eve and Caroline Edwards =96 founding members of the Open
   Library of Humanities <http://www.openlibhums.org/>
   *
   - *Cameron Neylon - Plos=92s Director of
Advocacy<http://www.plos.org/staff/cameron-neylon/>
   *
   - *Carrie Calder =96 Marketing Director of Palgrave
Macmillan<http://www.palgrave.com/>
   *

To *support HSS researchers,* the second day of the conference will include
*practical sessions* on topics including ORCID, funding open access
monographs, knowing your rights, finding a reputable OA publisher,
promoting your book and altmetrics. There will also be *sessions for
research funders, publishers, learned societies and institutional staff* to
discuss cross industry and international issues such as funding policies,
quality assurance, common standards, metadata, dissemination and discovery
and infrastructure to support archiving and preservation.

Delegates that attend this conference will leave feeling informed of the
relevant issues and equipped with useful information to assist in future
discussions and decision making within their organisation.
